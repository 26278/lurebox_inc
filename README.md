Optional course Interactive Design

# Lurebox

This repository contains a project of our optional course Interactive Design. We are building a user friendly website where we offer subscriptions for a monthly box of fishing lures. The main idea of this project is that we show that we can design and build a proper, user-friendly website from scratch in a semester. We have done the most of the work processes before, but some things are new for us, like a product research or creating a logo. 

## The team

UI / UX Designer: Jochem de Wit
Front-end Developer: Matthijs Berghuis

## Workflow

We use Trello to set up all the work processes and we're using it as a to-do list. It works pretty good, actually.
We're also using Slack for communicating and sending over some files or assets, because in our internships we're also using Slack and so we can seperate our project from other projects and assignments.

## Deadline

We have a semester of time for this project, and the hard deadline is at the 19th of June. At the 26th of June we presentate our project.
